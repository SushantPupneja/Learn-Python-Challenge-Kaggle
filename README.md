# Learn-Python-Challenge-Kaggle
Kaggke will start from the beginning and cover the fundamentals of the Python language in 7 short notebooks you can tackle with your morning coffee.  If you have some Python experience, you're still welcome to come along for a refresher. Kaggle will be throwing in a few extra-credit brainteasers that may stump even Python veterans.
